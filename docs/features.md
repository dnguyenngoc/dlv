### 2. **Lineage Processor** üîÑ
Process and store lineage data:

- [ ] Build graph relationships (nodes and edges)
- [ ] Update graph in real-time
- [ ] Batch processing for performance
- [ ] Normalize data from different sources
- [ ] Handle schema evolution
- [ ] Track lineage history

- [ ] Index management
- [ ] Connection pooling

### 4. **REST API** üåê
Expose lineage data via HTTP:

#### Endpoints:
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/lineage/graph` - Get full lineage graph
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/lineage/nodes` - List all nodes
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/lineage/edges` - List all edges
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/lineage/search` - Search lineage
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/lineage/node/:id` - Get node details
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/lineage/impact/:id` - Impact analysis
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/health` - Health check
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/metrics` - Prometheus metrics

### 5. **Frontend** üé®
React-based web interface:

#### 5.1 Graph Visualization
- [ ] Interactive graph view with Cytoscape.js
- [ ] Multiple layout algorithms (force-directed, hierarchical)
- [ ] Node and edge styling
- [ ] Zoom and pan controls
- [ ] Filter by node type
- [ ] Search integration

#### 5.2 Search & Filter
- [ ] Global search bar
- [ ] Filter by data source
- [ ] Filter by time range
- [ ] Filter by node type
- [ ] Quick filters

#### 5.3 Impact Analysis
- [ ] Select node to analyze
- [ ] Show downstream dependencies
- [ ] Show upstream dependencies
- [ ] Visualize impact path
- [ ] Estimate affected jobs

#### 5.4 Real-time Updates
- [ ] WebSocket connection
- [ ] Live graph updates
- [ ] Node change indicators
- [ ] Notification system

#### 5.5 Dashboard
- [ ] Overview statistics
- [ ] Recent lineage updates
- [ ] Active data sources
- [ ] Performance metrics

### 6. **Additional Features** üöÄ

- [ ] Time-travel debugging (view lineage at a point in time)
- [ ] What-if analysis (simulate changes)
- [ ] Export lineage graph (PNG, SVG, JSON)
- [ ] Multi-cluster support
- [ ] Custom resource definitions (CRDs)
- [ ] Graph comparison
- [ ] Anomaly detection
