# DLV v1.0.0 – Business Plan (MVP)

Release date: YYYY-MM-DD

## 1) Product Vision
A self‑hosted, lightweight platform that gives data teams a live map of data flows and the fastest way to assess impact, troubleshoot incidents, and satisfy audit lineage needs.

## 2) Who It’s For
- Data platform / SRE for data
- Data / analytics engineers
- Governance & compliance
- Eng leaders seeking lower MTTR and higher delivery confidence

## 3) Value Propositions
- End‑to‑end lineage visibility (Spark, Airflow, DBs) to answer “what breaks if this fails?”
- Near real‑time pipeline health so incidents are detected/triaged faster
- One place to document, annotate and monitor flows (dashboards)
- Self‑hosted, runs in your VPC; easy incremental adoption

## 4) MVP Scope (v1.0)
- Auth & RBAC: admin (full), viewer (read‑only)
- Node catalog (Spark, Airflow, PostgreSQL) with connection configs
- Lineage model (nodes, edges), basic metadata (owner, tags)
- Dashboards: save/load visual canvas (layouts)
- Health: manual “test connection” (PostgreSQL), simple status (ok/error)
- Impact analysis: upstream/downstream traversal (basic)
- API‑first backend (FastAPI); UI comes next

## 5) Out of Scope (post‑v1.0)
- Collectors/schedulers (Celery + Redis), real‑time updates (WebSocket)
- Neo4j lineage storage & graph queries
- Full UI (React Flow editor, D3 lineage)
- Alerts, SLA rules, advanced governance features

## 6) Success Metrics (MVP)
- MTTR / TTD reduced on target teams
- Lineage coverage (% key pipelines captured)
- % incidents with impact analysis in < 5 minutes
- # active dashboards and annotated nodes per team

## 7) Timeline (indicative)
- Weeks 1–3: Backend MVP (auth, nodes/edges, dashboards, test connection), Swagger & Docker
- Weeks 4–6: React Flow dashboards, basic impact analysis, (optional) Neo4j POC
- Weeks 7–9: Monitoring loop (Celery/Redis), real‑time status, annotations/owner/SLA

## 8) Packaging (Placeholder)
- Community (self‑hosted, core lineage + basics)
- Team (RBAC, alerting, support)
- Enterprise (SSO/SAML, audit logs, SLAs, custom collectors)

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- Integration breadth → start with Spark/Airflow/Postgres; add Kafka later
- Data sensitivity → store metadata/lineage only
- Ops complexity → Compose/Helm + clear runbooks & examples

## 10) Call‑to‑Action (v1.0)
- Deploy via Docker Compose, add your first 3–5 critical pipelines
- Create a dashboard mapping a business‑critical flow, annotate owners & SLAs
- Use MVP for impact analysis during next incident; gather feedback to shape v1.x
